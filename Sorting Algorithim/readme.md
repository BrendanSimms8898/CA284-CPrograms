This contains 4 working sorting algorithims that allow you to test speed of the sorts with a normal randomly generated array and a reversed array.
These arrays are limited to 100,000 due to arrays memory being on the stack rather than real memory this means that if I was to redo this project I would use global variables or a vector
instead of an array to avoid the limit on array size.
